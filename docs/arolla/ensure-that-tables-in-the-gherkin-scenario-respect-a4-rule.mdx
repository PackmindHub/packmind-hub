# Ensure that tables in the gherkin scenario respect A4 rule

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.MEDIUM} />

<Categories categories={["BDD"]} />

The A4 rule for writing Gherkin scenarios is a guideline that aims to keep scenarios concise and manageable. The "A4" reference comes from the standard size of a piece of paper, suggesting that a scenario should ideally fit within an A4 sheet.

	When I aggregate by buckets
	Then I get
