# Do not use Java double brace initialization

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.MEDIUM} />

Java double brace initialisation is an anti-pattern.

Cf. https://www.baeldung.com/java-double-brace-initialization

Disadvantages of using double braces are:

Obscure, not widely known way to do the initialization
    It creates an extra class every time we use it
    Doesn’t support the use of the “diamond operator” – a feature introduced in Java 7
    Doesn’t work if the class we are trying to extend is marked final
    Holds a hidden reference to the enclosing instance, which may cause memory leaks

It’s due to these disadvantages that double brace initialization is considered as an anti-pattern.

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
Incorrect implementation that violates the practice.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Order order = new Order() {{
            setReference("abc-123");
            setCustomer("John Doe");
        }};

    }
}
```
