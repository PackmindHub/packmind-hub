## AI-generated description suggestion
##### What is it?
The practice is triggered when enum values in code are found in lowercase or mixed-case formats instead of uppercase.

##### Why apply it?
Using uppercase for enum values ensures consistency, aligns with coding standards for named constants, and increases code readability by distinguishing these special types from variables and functions.

##### How to fix it?
Change the enum values from their current format to uppercase, ensuring consistency and readability throughout the codebase.
