# Use for of for increasing the performance of loop

##### What is it?
The practice is triggered when iterating over iterable objects like arrays or strings using a traditional for loop or for-in loop instead of the modern for-of loop.

##### Why apply it?
The for-of loop provides better performance and readability by directly iterating over values of an iterable object, thus eliminating issues associated with iterating over non-numeric properties or inherited properties of objects.

##### How to fix it?
Convert the for or for-in loop to a for-of loop to directly access the values of the iterable object with simpler syntax and improved clarity.

for(let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i])
}
