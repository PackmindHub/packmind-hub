# Avoid Using Non-existent Reversed Operators `=+`, `=-`, and `=!` in TypeScript

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.HIGH} />

---

<Categories categories={["Maintainability","Correctness"]} />

## What is it?
This practice is triggered by the accidental use of operator pairs (`=+`, `=-`, or `=!`) that resemble their compound counterparts (`+=`, `-=`, or `!=`) but behave very differently. These pairs compile and run but do not perform the intended operation, which can lead to subtle bugs and confusing code.

## Why apply it?
Using these reversed operator sequences can be misleading:
• They may appear to modify a variable with compounded arithmetic or comparison operations, but instead, they result in an assignment of an expression processed by a unary operator.
• This misusage undermines code clarity and increases the risk of logic errors.
• Correcting these issues early helps to ensure your code’s behavior matches your intent and improves maintainability.

## How to Fix it?
If your intention is to perform a compound operation, use the proper operator such as `+=` or `-=`. If you intend to assign a unary negated or positive value, ensure that the operator and spacing clearly reflect that intention (for instance, having a space between the assignment operator and the unary operator).

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
Correct implementation following the practice.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```ts
let temperature: number = 25;
let drop: number = 5;
temperature -= drop; // Compliant: subtracts drop from temperature correctly
console.log("New temperature:", temperature);
if (temperature < 20) {
  console.log("Temperature is getting low.");
}
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
Incorrect implementation that violates the practice.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```ts
let balance: number = -100;
let deposit: number = 50;
balance =+ deposit; // Noncompliant: assigns +deposit instead of adding deposit to balance
console.log("Balance after deposit:", balance);
if (balance < 0) {
  console.log("Warning: account is overdrawn.");
}
```

### Example 2:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
Correct implementation following the practice.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```ts
let balance: number = -100;
let deposit: number = 50;
balance += deposit; // Compliant: correctly adds deposit to balance
console.log("Updated balance:", balance);
if (balance < 0) {
  console.log("Account is overdrawn.");
}
```

### Example 3:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
Correct implementation following the practice.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```ts
let userInput: string = "admin";
let expectedInput: string = "user";
if (userInput !== expectedInput) { // Compliant: uses proper inequality operator for comparison
  console.log("User input does not match the expected input.");
} else {
  console.log("User input matches.");
}
console.log("Comparison complete.");
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
Incorrect implementation that violates the practice.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```ts
let temperature: number = 25;
let drop: number = 5;
temperature =- drop; // Noncompliant: assigns -drop instead of subtracting drop from temperature
console.log("Temperature after drop:", temperature);
if (temperature < 20) {
  console.log("Alert: temperature is critically low.");
}
```

### Example 4:

<!-- #example -->

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
Incorrect implementation that violates the practice.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```ts
let userInput: string = "admin";
let expectedInput: string = "user";
let isDifferent: boolean;
isDifferent =! (userInput === expectedInput); // Noncompliant: confusing usage, assigns the negation of the comparison result
if (isDifferent) {
  console.log("User input is different from expected.");
} else {
  console.log("User input matches.");
}
console.log("Check completed.");
```
