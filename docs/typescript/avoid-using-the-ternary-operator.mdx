# Avoid Using the Ternary Operator

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.MEDIUM} />

---

<Categories categories={["maintainability","readability"]} />

## What is it?
This practice is triggered by the use of the ternary operator, which can lead to code that is difficult to read, especially when nested or used with complex conditions.

## Why apply it?
Although ternary expressions can be concise, they often sacrifice clarity for brevity. Replacing them with explicit control structures such as if/else statements enhances code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of introducing subtle bugs.

## How to Fix it?
Replace ternary expressions with clear if/else structures that explicitly explain the decision-making process, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
This example uses a ternary operator to assign a value, which is less clear and harder to maintain, especially as complexity increases.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```ts
function evaluateStatus(status: string): string {
  // Using a ternary operator to determine the status (Noncompliant)
  const result = (status === 'Active') ? 'Status is active' : 'Status is inactive';
  console.log("Status evaluated successfully.");
  console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
  return result;
}
```

### Example 2:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
This example uses an if/else structure to assign a value based on a condition, which improves readability over a ternary operator.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```ts
function evaluateStatus(status: string): string {
  let result: string;
  // Check if the status is 'Active'
  if (status === 'Active') {
    result = 'Status is active';
  } else {
    result = 'Status is inactive';
  }
  console.log("Status evaluated successfully.");
  console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
  return result;
}
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
This example uses nested ternary operators to determine a grade based on a numeric score. The nested structure makes it more difficult to follow the logic and increases the risk of mistakes.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```ts
function determineGrade(score: number): string {
  // Using nested ternary operators to decide the grade (Noncompliant)
  const grade = (score >= 90) ? 'A' 
               : (score >= 80) ? 'B'
               : 'C';
  console.log("Grade determined based on score.");
  console.log(`Score: ${score}, Grade: ${grade}`);
  return grade;
}
```

### Example 3:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
This example replaces a nested ternary operator with an if/else if/else chain to determine a grade based on a numeric score, providing clearer logic flow.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```ts
function determineGrade(score: number): string {
  let grade: string;
  // Decide grade based on the score
  if (score >= 90) {
    grade = 'A';
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    grade = 'B';
  } else {
    grade = 'C';
  }
  console.log("Grade determined based on score.");
  console.log(`Score: ${score}, Grade: ${grade}`);
  return grade;
}
```
