# Ensure `Object.wait(...)` and `Condition.await(...)` are Used Inside a "while" Loop

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.HIGH} />

---

<Categories categories={["correctness","synchronization"]} />

### What is it?
In a multithreaded environment, using `Object.wait(...)` or `Condition.await(...)` methods inappropriately can lead to faulty thread execution due to "spurious wakeups".

### Why apply it?
If `wait()` or `await()` is not called inside a loop that checks the condition, spurious wakeups could cause incorrect behavior by assuming the condition is met when it isn't.

### How to fix it?
Ensure `wait()` or `await()` calls are made inside a `while` loop that checks the condition. This ensures that logic is executed only when the condition is confirmed to be true.

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
This noncompliant example uses `if`, which can result in code execution despite spurious wakeups.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java
synchronized (lock) {
  if (!conditionMet()) {
    lock.wait();  // Noncompliant; `wait` is not in a loop
  }
  // Risky execution as condition might not be true.
  processTask();
}
```

### Example 2:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
This compliant example uses a `while` loop to ensure that the condition is checked continuously even after spurious wakeups.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```java
synchronized (lock) {
  while (!conditionMet()) {
    lock.wait();  // Compliant; `wait` is in a loop and re-checks the condition
  }
  // Execute logic safely assuming the condition is met
  processTask();
}
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
A noncompliant example that uses an `if` statement, vulnerable to spurious wakeups.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java
synchronized (lock) {
  if (sharedQueue.isEmpty()) {
    lock.wait();  // Noncompliant; `wait` is not used inside a loop
  }
  // May fail if queue is empty due to wakeup
  Object item = sharedQueue.poll();
  handleItem(item);
}
```

### Example 3:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
The compliant example handles concurrency correctly with a `while` loop that ensures the condition is met.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```java
synchronized (lock) {
  while (sharedQueue.isEmpty()) {
    lock.wait();  // Compliant; waits inside a loop, guarding the condition
  }
  // Process an item from the queue
  Object item = sharedQueue.poll();
  handleItem(item);
}
```
