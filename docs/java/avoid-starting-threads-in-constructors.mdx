# Avoid Starting Threads in Constructors

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.HIGH} />

---

<Categories categories={["reliability","concurrency"]} />

### What is it?
This rule is triggered when a `Thread.start()` method is called within a constructor of a non-`final` class.

### Why apply it?
Starting a thread in a constructor can lead to complex and hard-to-debug issues, especially if the class is extended. The child class might not be fully initialized when the thread starts.

### How to fix it?
Avoid starting a thread within the constructor. Instead, provide a method to start the thread after the construction of the object is complete.

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
The negative example starts a thread in the constructor, risking it is started before the object is fully initialized.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java
public class MyClass {

    private Thread thread = null;

    public MyClass(Runnable runnable) {
        thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();  // Noncompliant
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass(() -> System.out.println("Running in thread"));
        // Risky: the thread has already started before myClass is fully available
    }
}
```

### Example 2:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
In the positive example, the thread is started via a separate method, ensuring the object is fully initialized before starting the thread.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```java
public class MyClass {

    private Thread thread = null;

    public MyClass(Runnable runnable) {
        thread = new Thread(runnable);
    }

    public void startThread() {
        thread.start();  // Compliant
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass(() -> System.out.println("Running in thread"));
        myClass.startThread();
    }
}
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
In this negative example, the thread starts in the constructor leading to potential concurrency issues with inheritance.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java
public class Worker {

    private Thread workerThread = null;

    public Worker(Runnable task) {
        workerThread = new Thread(task);
        workerThread.start();  // Noncompliant
    }
}

public class Manager {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker worker = new Worker(() -> {
            System.out.println("Worker is executing a task");
        });
        // The thread may operate on an incompletely initialized object
    }
}
```

### Example 3:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
In the positive example, a separate initialization method is used to start the thread after the object is fully constructed.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```java
public class Worker {

    private Thread workerThread = null;

    public Worker(Runnable task) {
        workerThread = new Thread(task);
    }

    public void startWorker() {
        workerThread.start();  // Compliant
    }
}

public class Manager {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker worker = new Worker(() -> {
            System.out.println("Worker is executing a task");
        });
        worker.startWorker();  // Safe to start after construction
    }
}
```
