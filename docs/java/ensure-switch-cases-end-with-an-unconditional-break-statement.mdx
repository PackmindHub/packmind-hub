# Ensure Switch Cases End with an Unconditional `break` Statement

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.HIGH} />

<Categories categories={["maintainability","reliability","clarity"]} />

### What is it?
This practice is triggered when a switch case does not end with an explicit termination, such as a `break` statement, which can lead to the execution falling through to subsequent cases.

### Why apply it?
Forgetting to add a `break` statement often leads to unintended fall-through behavior where subsequent case statements are executed. This results in bugs that are difficult to trace and can make the code harder to read and maintain.

### How to fix it?
Ensure each case in a switch statement ends with an unconditional break, return, throw, or continue statement, unless intentionally allowing fallthrough with a comment.

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
The negative example lacks break statements, causing unintended fall-through except for the last executed case.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java
switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case "Monday":
    doStartOfWeekRoutine();
  case "Wednesday":  // fall-through will execute doStartOfWeekRoutine and doMidWeekAnalysis
    doMidWeekAnalysis();
  case "Friday":
    prepareForWeekend();
  default:
    restAndRelax();
    break;
}
```

### Example 2:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
The positive example shows a switch statement where each case ends with a `break` statement, preventing unintended fall-through.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```java
switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case "Monday":
    doStartOfWeekRoutine();
    break;
  case "Wednesday":
    doMidWeekAnalysis();
    break;
  case "Friday":
    prepareForWeekend();
    break;
  default:
    restAndRelax();
    break;
}
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
The negative example includes cases where the lack of break statements results in unintended execution of subsequent cases.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```java
switch (statusCode) {
  case 200:
    logSuccess();
  case 202:  // lack of break causes fall-through here unintentionally
    handleProcessing();
  case 404:
    handleNotFound();
  default:
    logUnknownStatus();
}
```
