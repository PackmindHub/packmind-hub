# Wrap image and caption inside figure with proper aria attributes

<Severity severity={SeverityLevels.MEDIUM} />

<Categories categories={["accessibility","react","JSX"]} />

### What
This practice applies when displaying images that require captions. It is triggered when an image (or image-like element) is paired with a legend but is not enclosed within a semantic container. Violations include using generic containers like &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt; that do not communicate the association to assistive technologies.

### Why
Grouping an image with its caption inside a &lt;figure&gt; element with the proper WAI-ARIA role helps assistive technologies understand their relationship. This improves the accessibility of the web content and ensures compliance with standards like WCAG.

### Fix
Wrap the image and its caption in a &lt;figure&gt; element, set the role attribute to either "figure" or "group", and use a &lt;figcaption&gt; element for the caption. This establishes a clear association between the image and its legend.

## Examples

### Example 1:

<!-- #example -->

#### Positive

<!-- #example_positive_description -->
This example correctly groups the image and its caption within a &lt;figure&gt; element with appropriate ARIA attributes.

<!-- #example_positive_code -->
```tsx
import React from "react";

export const AccessibleImage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <figure role="figure" aria-label="Photo: Sunset over the mountains">
      <img src="sunset.png" alt="Sunset over the mountains" />
      <figcaption>Photo: Sunset over the mountains</figcaption>
    </figure>
  );
};

export default AccessibleImage;
```

#### Negative

<!-- #example_negative_description -->
The image and its caption are not grouped in a semantic &lt;figure&gt; element with appropriate ARIA roles, making it less accessible.

<!-- #example_negative_code -->
```tsx
import React from "react";

export const InaccessibleImage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="sunset.png" alt="Sunset over the mountains" />
      <p>Photo: Sunset over the mountains</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default InaccessibleImage;
```
